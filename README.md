# Notion Editor Documentation

The Notion Editor is a project aimed at providing users with essential formatting options to structure their content. Currently, the available options in the editor include creating headings, expanded headings, paragraphs, and expanded paragraphs. However, the design specifications initially outlined support only two main options: normal paragraphs and headings. As a result, the current functionality limits users to creating only headings and paragraphs without the expanded formatting.

## Available Options:

1. **Heading:** : Users can create regular headings. These headings follow the conventional styling without any expanded options attached. To create a regular heading type: "/1" and select the first option "Heading 1" Also there is a shortcut just type: `# + space`.

2. **Expanded Heading:** Users for now can't create expanded headings because they were not provided in the design but for now they are just simulating the functionality of regular Headings. You can still test it when typing `/1` or using the shortcut `>># + space`.

3. **Paragraph:** Users can create regular paragraphs. These paragraphs follow the conventional styling without any expanded options attached. To create a regular paragraph type: `/+1` and select the first option "Paragraph 1" Also there is a shortcut just type: `+#`.

4. **Expanded Paragraph:** Expanded Paragraph: Users for now can't create expanded paragraphs because they were not provided in the design but for now they are just simulating the functionality of regular paragraphs. You can still test it when typing `/+1` or using the shortcut  `+>># + space`.

More features can be added to the editor in the future if required. If you have any questions or need clarification about the Notion Editor project, please don't hesitate to ask.
