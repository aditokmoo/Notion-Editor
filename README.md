# Notion Editor Documentation

The Notion Editor is a project focused on providing users with essential formatting options to structure their content. Presently, the editor offers several options for creating headings and paragraphs, although the original design specifications only support two main options: normal paragraphs and headings. Consequently, the current functionality limits users to creating only headings and paragraphs without expanded formatting.

## Available Options:

1. **Heading:** Users can create regular headings. These headings follow conventional styling without any expanded options attached. To create a regular heading, type: `/1` and select the first option "Heading 1". Additionally, there's a shortcut: `# + space`.

2. **Expanded Heading:** Expanded heading functionality is not currently available due to it not being included in the design. However, it's simulated as a regular heading. To test, type `/1` or use the shortcut `>># + space`.

3. **Paragraph:** Users can create regular paragraphs. These paragraphs follow conventional styling without any expanded options attached. To create a regular paragraph, type: `/+1` and select the first option "Paragraph 1". Shortcut: `+#`.

4. **Expanded Paragraph:** Similar to expanded headings, expanded paragraph functionality is not currently available based on design specifications. It is simulated as a regular paragraph. To test, type `/+1` or use the shortcut `+>># + space`.

Additional features may be added to the editor in the future based on user requirements. If you have any questions or need clarification about the Notion Editor project, please don't hesitate to ask.
