The Notion Editor | Documentation

The Notion Editor is a project aimed at providing users with essential formatting options to structure their content. Currently, the available options in the editor include creating headings, expanded headings, paragraphs, and expanded paragraphs. However, the design specifications initially outlined support only two main options: normal paragraphs and headings. As a result, the current functionality limits users to creating only headings and paragraphs without the expanded formatting.
Options:
1. Heading: Users can create regular headings. These headings follow the conventional styling without any expanded options attached. To create regular heading type: "/1" and select first option "Heading 1" also there is shortcut just type: "# + space".
2. Expanded Heading: Users for now can't create expanded heading because they were not provided in design but for now they are just simulating functionality of regular Heading. You can still test it when typing "/1" or using shortcut ">># + space".
3. Paragraph: Users can create regular paragraphs. These paragraphs follow the conventional styling without any expanded options attached. To create regular paragraph type: "/+1" and select first option "Paragraph 1" also there is shortcut just type: "+#".
4. Expanded Paragraph: Users for now can't create expanded paragraph because they were not provided in design but for now they are just simulating functionality of regular paragraph. You can still test it when typing "/+1" or using shortcut "+>># + space".
More features can be added to the editor in the future if required. If you have any questions or need clarification about the Notion Editor project, please don't hesitate to ask.
